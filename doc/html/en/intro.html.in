 <li> Ngraph science and engineering students, researchers,
      two-dimensional graphing program designed for engineers.
 <li> Plotted on a graph can be read from a text file with numeric data
      versatility. 
 <li> Presentation can be created for the paper chart. 
 <li> Simple data analysis to assist.

<h2> <a href="./intro.html">Preferences</a> </h2>
<br>
<div>
<ul>
 <li> When you upgrade the Ngraph in ~ /. Please do not forget to delete
      the created Ngraph.ini Ngraph. Ngraph.ini old will be loaded as
      Ngraph.ini configuration has been changed otherwise.
</ul>
<p> The following describes the files used by the directory search order Ngraph. </p>
<h3> (1) Read the initialization file </h3>
<p> Ngraph requires two initialization files. </p>
<dl>
<dt> Ngraph.nsc
 <dd> Script file for reading and analysis of command line options for
     the default graph style. This script reads the file Ngraph.ngp
     further.
 <dt> Ngraph.ini
 <dd> Configuration file that lists the initial values Ngraph
</dl>
<p> Search order for reading these files is as follows. </p>
<ol>
 <li> ~/.Ngraph
 <li> CONFDIRDEF
</ol>
<h3> (2) Writing in the initialization file </h3>
<p> Ngraph at the end of your ~ /. Ngraph.ini to create a Ngraph. In
addition, [Graph] - [save as default (Graph)] creates a menu
Ngraph.ngp. These priorities are creating a file in the directory
below. </p>
<ol>
 <li> ~/.Ngraph
 <li> CONFDIRDEF
</ol>
<h3> (3) printer driver, run the add-in scripts </h3>
<p> Search order for external programs such as printer drivers or add-in scripts are as follows. </p>
<ol>
 <li> ~/.Ngraph
 <li> LIBDIRDEF
 <li> PATH environment variable
</ol>
