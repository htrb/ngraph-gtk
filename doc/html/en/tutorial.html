 <li><h3> To provide a data file </h3>
      <br>
      <br>
      Create a chart Ngraph read data from a data file.  Therefore, you
      must first prepare the data files.  Editor, spreadsheet program,
      create a data file or from the measuring device control
      software. <br>
      <br>
 <li><h3> Determine the type of graph </h3>
      <br>
      <br>
      Start Ngraph Once you have the data file to the chart.  Determine
      the type of chart you want to create next.  Are classified in the
      following three Ngraph.
      <p>
      <table border=1>

       </tr>
      </table>
      </p>
      Initially one has created a frame chart.  Four of the frame axis
      scale so the graph is not set yet, and only the frame is displayed
      showing the baseline axis.  If you like this continue.  To create
      other types of charts, graphs] - [New] ([Graph] - [New graph])
      specifies the type of graph to create the menu. <br>
      <br>
 <li><h3>Open Data File </h3>
      <br>
      <br>
      Next, open the data file you have prepared.  To open the data file
      is a variety of ways, anyway [Data] - [Add] to
      select the item, please open a data file in the file selection
      dialog box. <br>
      <p>
      How to Open a data file is also available to others.

       <li> Select the data files from other file manager, drag and drop
	    it onto the Data Window or the Viewer Window.
      </ol>
      </p>
      In either case, the open dialog box to specify the data and how to plot and then specify the data file, please close the OK anyway. <br>
      <br>
 <li><h3> Draw </h3>
      <br>
      <br>
      Automatically open the file in Ngraph is not to draw.  To draw a graph, please press the button below. <br>

 <li> <h3> Changing the scale </h3>
      <br>
      <br>
      In particular scale (upper and lower limits of the axes) when
      drawn without setting a value is determined by auto-scaling.  The
      Axis Window has also listed the axis.  In the case of frame graph
      has four axes, respectively &quot;fX1&quot;, &quot;fY1&quot;,
      &quot;fU1&quot;, &quot;fR1&quot; and has a name.  To change the
      scale of these axes, please double-click the axis you want to
      change select from a list of Axis Window as shown below.

      Opens a dialog box like this and below the axis.  Here, the
      &quot;minimum&quot; &quot;maximum&quot; &quot;increment&quot; of
      the scale of the axis minimum, maximum, please specify the
      increment.  For incremental graduations are marked with numbers.
      &quot;Division number&quot; should be &quot;incremental&quot; to
      decide what to draw a line equal to an additional graduation.
      This value is 0 when the number of segments is determined
      automatically.  Law &quot;scale&quot; in a normal linear axis
      (linear), log (log), reciprocal (inverse), you can choose one of
      the MJD.  &quot;File&quot; can be determined by performing an
      auto-scaling in the data file from the specified file button to
      open the scale. <br>
      &quot;Clear&quot; is set to unset the scale.

     the previous section, the focus you want replicas Legend (selected)
     state that (when surrounded by dotted lines) position.  If you make
     a copy of the legend if more than one, please state it is focused
     on several legends surrounding them with the mouse.  Press the INS
     key here (pop-up menu or issue the &quot;Duplicate&quot; to select
     the menu) will produce a duplicate of the legend that is the focus.
     Replication will be generated in the same position, only one
     visible overlap.  But after replication, so legend has been
     replicated only focus will move only if you drag to the desired
     cloned. <br>

       <li> To create a new graph <br>
	    <br>
	    If you want to create multiple charts on one sheet of paper,
	    the Axis - Create the Add button to specify the type of
	    chart you want from the menu.  Or below the control buttons
	    <p>
	    <img src="../img/addgraph.png" alt="">
	    </p>
	    Press the graph (axis) can also be created by specifying the
	    location with the mouse over the Viewer Window and the mode
	    of preparation. <br>
	    <br>
       <li> To replicate the chart that you have already created <br>
	    <br>
	    There have already created a chart, to add a new chart just
	    like that, but the duplicate would have already created a
	    chart that is easier and more realistic.  To do this, press
	    the button below the mouse pointer (selection) mode.  This
	    mode selection is a legend and axis (which is also thought
	    to replicate with legend).
	    <p>
	    <img src="../img/lapoint.png" alt="">
	    </p>
	    Next, specify the range with the mouse over graph you want

	    select all the graphs and the legend of the mouse within the
	    range, are surrounded by dotted lines.  Press the INS key in
	    this state (or out the pop-up menu &quot;Duplicate&quot; to
	    select the menu), and the graph is duplicated legend has
	    been selected.  At this time, the focus (selected) is not
	    only a legend and a new chart that is replicated, the source
	    is not selected.  Please Allow the mouse to drag in this
	    state.  Typically, when you create multiple graphs
	    vertically, but is often located next to or align, it will
	    not only move horizontally and vertically by dragging them
	    while holding down the CTRL key when shifting the position
	    of the mouse can be easily justified.

      <br>
 <li><h3>The name of the axis</h3>
      <br>
      <br>
      Frame and grid graph is a graph of the four axes (axis X, axis Y,
      axis U, axis R) is composed. Also, the two axes intersect the
      graph (axis X, axis Y) consists of. These axes are automatically
      given a unique name so that you can create multiple graphs. The
      name of the axis has the following form.
      <p>
      <table border=1>
       <tr align=CENTER>
	<td> Chart type</td>
	<td> Axis </td>

	 R
	</td>
	<td>Is swung from one chart for each type of</td>
       </tr>
      </table>
      </p>
      For example, the name of the axis of the graph that you create the
      first frame fX1, fY1, fU1, next fR1, the name of the axis of the
      second frame charts created fX2, fY2, fU2, is fR2.

      section.<br>
      <br>
 <li><h3>Axial coordination</h3>

      </dl>
      <br>
      These &quot;reference axis&quot;, &quot;button position&quot; -
      &quot;cross-axis&quot; can be specified respectively. <br>
      <br>
      The axis as described earlier, are marked with serial numbers
      starting from 0. Furthermore, (as well as any other graphic
      object) are marked with numbers uniquely determined at run time
      (specified as a number starting with ^). The end of the Axis
      Window "^#" this number is the number that appears in the
      part. The above "reference axis" or "button position" -
      "cross-axis" are actually entered into if you choose a name from
      the combo box list of the axis, the number "uniquely determined at
      run time" is. "Serial number" and you have specified in the will
      change in number of such cases have been deleted shaft so

      have been to.<br> If you want to graph more common X-axis, fU2 fX2
      by simply changing the scale of the axes and set the Reference
